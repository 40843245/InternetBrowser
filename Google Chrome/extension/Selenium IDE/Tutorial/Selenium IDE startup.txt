In this article, I will talk about startup of Selenium IDE.

-------------------------------------
Introduction:
Selenium IDE is an IDE in google chrome's extension which can record your behavior in the specific website.

-------------------------------------
Preparation:
(2.1)Check Google Chrome is downloaded.
(2.2)Check Google Chrome Play Store can be used.
(2.3)Check the option "google extension is allowed" in google chrome settings.

-------------------------------------
Startup:
(3.1)If google chrome is NOT downloaded, Download google chrome first.
Link:
https://www.google.com/intl/zh-tw/chrome/
By default, google chrome play store can be used when google chrome is downloaded.
(3.2)Open Google Chrome instead of using other web browsers!!!
NOT use other web browsers!!!
NOT use other web browsers!!!
NOT use other web browsers!!!
(3.3)In google chrome, go to google chrome play store and then search Selenium IDE.
Link:
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/selenium-ide/mooikfkahbdckldjjndioackbalphokd
(3.4)click "add to chrome" to add the Selenium IDE extension in google chrome.
(3.5)Add icons in google chrome.
(3.6)Click the icon.

Or alternatively, you can skip step (3.5) to (3.6) by clicking the extension. (BUT it is NOT convenient)

(3.7)
When startup of Selenium IDE, it asks you what you would like to do.
For recording, select "record a new test for a new project".

(3.8)Follow the steps on it. Then
That's done.

-------------------------------------
P.S.
NOTE that:
The Selenium IDE does NOT save your project online.
If the next time you want to use it, you have to save the project as .side file.
When the next time you use it, open the existing project.
